# Advent-of-Code
My Advent of Code shenanigans.

## 2023
My plan for this year is to get some more experience with Rust, especially with iterators. I also want to experiment with tests a bit.
I have no ambitions to get on the leaderboard, nor do i promise to deliver the 'best' solutions by any metric.
