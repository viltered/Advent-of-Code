# Advent-of-Code
Advent of Code shenanigans.

## 2023
My plan for this year is to get some more experience with Rust, especially with iterators and tests. I also want to get used to publishing things online without overthinking...
I have no ambitions to get on the leaderboard, nor do i intend to find the best solutions by any metric.
